I created this Pre-work Study Guide becasue I wanted to create a simple and effiective way to track my progress throughout learning to code in this course!
This project is my very first website which I have built completeley from scratch using only code! I wanted to create this to see if it was possible for me to do.
The project helps me to understand a breakdown of the four languages used to create this project. 
I learned about GitHub and more about DevTools, HTML and CSS. JavaScript is new to me and I am still getting my head around that one!

## Installation

## Usage

Each section of the project shows a really helpfull breakdown of what had to be learned to create it. And what's more, anyone can open DevTools to dive deeper under the hood and inspect the Console, the Network and the Elements to see how everything was put together to produce the final project.
